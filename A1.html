                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct
                population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of
                agriculture. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
